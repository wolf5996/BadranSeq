# BadranSeq

-   `BadranSeq` provides convenience functions to make transcriptomic analyses more pleasant, with a focus on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data

-   The package offers intuitive tools for visualization and computation of useful metrics to streamline your RNA-Seq workflow.

## Key Features

-   **Visualization Tools**: Built-in ggplot2-based functions for common scRNA-Seq plots
-   **Metric Computation**: Calculate useful transcriptomic metrics with ease
-   **Data Wrangling**: Streamlined functions using dplyr and tidyverse principles
-   **Convenience Functions**: Reduce repetitive code in your RNA-Seq analysis workflows
-   **scRNA-Seq Focus**: Specialized tools tailored for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis

## Installation

You can install the development version of BadranSeq from GitHub:

``` r
# Install from GitHub
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wolf5996/BadranSeq")

# Or using pak (recommended)
if (!require(pak)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("wolf5996/BadranSeq")
```

### Dependencies

BadranSeq requires R \>= 3.5 and depends on the following packages:

-   **Core dependencies**: dplyr, ggplot2, magrittr, purrr, stringr
-   **Suggested packages**: testthat, tidyr

All dependencies will be installed automatically when you install BadranSeq.
